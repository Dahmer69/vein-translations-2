# vein-translations

These translations will be imported regularly into VEIN to translate the game into various locales.

Please make a pull request to modify translations.

Instructions for non-technical users to be written soon!

## Notes

- Only languages with > 80% completion will be added for selection in VEIN. This may change depending on how much time we have to give players a warning about their language support being incomplete.
- We understand this is a difficult system we've made, so hopefully it can be replaced with something more user-friendly in the future.

## Contributing

### New Language

If you are looking to add your language to VEIN, please message us on Discord or otherwise and we will generate an initial `.csv` file for you.

### Editing Translations - Non Technical

Each of the `.csv` files correspond to a locale, which is often just a language. In the case of Spanish for example, there are many different dialects, so choose `es-419.csv` for South American Spanish instead of `es-ES` for Spain Spanish.

You can download these, put them in Google Drive or open them with Microsoft Excel or any editor, and start adding/replacing translations.

When done, export back to CSV. Open it in Notepad or another text editor of your choice.

In GitHub, open the file corresponding to your edited one, then click the pencil icon in the top-right of the file.

Paste your file's contents there and make a pull request, and we will review and merge it in.

### Editing Translations - Technical

Clone the repo to a directory of your choice; make edits to the files you'd like; then make a pull request to be reviewed.
